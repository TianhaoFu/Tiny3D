## Introduction 
Tiny3D is a light weight 3d object detection service production system.
Tiny3D solution embodies two transformative features: 
1. **a Performance Optimization Engine** for 3d object detection online/offline inference services product performance optimization. Through this engine users can easily get a high accuracy and high speed 3d object detection service/competetion result in a data-model double centeric ai way
2. **a user-friendly web interface** for a developer team to product a 3d object detection service pictorially, in a low-code fashion

## Features
- Data centric
- Compressor with prediction function
- A user-friendly web interface
- Performance Optimization Engine can easily be a Plug-in to any machine learning system.

## Lidar data operations currently supported
- lidar data loading
- lidar data sampling
- lidar data preprocessing/cleaning
- lidar data denoising
- lidar data augmentation
- lidar data simulation
- lidar data selection
- lidar data robustion
- lidar data domain adptation
- lidar data auto-labeling

## Lidar based 3d object detection model operations currently supported
- model compression
